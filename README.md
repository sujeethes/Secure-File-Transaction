# Secure-File-Transaction
In this project we have introduced secure RSA for secure file transmission. There are many
cases where we need secure file transmission for example in banking transactions, e-shopping
etc. In this project we present modified RSA algorithm for secure file
transmission.Cryptography is the process of converting plain text into encrypted text and
decrypt cipher text to plain text at other end. RSA algorithm is asymmetric key cryptography
also called Public Key cryptography. Two keys are generated in RSA, one key is used for
encryption and other key which is only known to authenticated receiver can decrypt message.
No other key can decrypt the message. Every communicating party needs just a key pair for
communicating with any number of other communicating parties. Once someone obtains a
key pair, he /she can communicate with anyone else. RSA is a well known public key
cryptography algorithm and was one of the first great advances in public key cryptography.
Even if it is efficient algorithm it is vulnerable to attackers. With the help of all brute force
attacks hacker can obtain private key. Many improvements has been done to improve RSA
like BATCH RSA, MultiPrime RSA, MultiPower RSA, Rebalanced RSA, RPrime RSA etc.
As craze of internet is increasing exponentially, it is used for email, chatting, transferring data
and files from one end to other. It needs to be a secure communication among the two parties.
This project focuses on file transfer using Secure RSA, which eliminates some loopholes of
RSA that might prevent a hacker from stealing and misuse of data. This project also presents
comparison between RSA file transfer and Secure RSA file transfer.
Here we use MD5 hashing algorithm for authentication purpose.
